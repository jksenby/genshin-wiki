# Genshin-wiki

How can you see from the name of repository it is genshin impact wiki. 

I used only Javascript, HTML and CSS(bootstrap, jquery) in this project. I added grid layout system and was trying to use bootstrap as useful as i can. It is kind of challenge for me to get a little out of the habit of React and start using usual HTML and Javascript because i want to start Angular
